# Welcome to my travel blog!

The purpose of this repository is to build a blog website to show you what I get up to in my spare time when traveling. You can also use this as a foundation for your website too.

Tech stack:
- Node.js Express
- Handlebars Templating
- Azure Blob Storage (Coming soon!)
- AZD CLI template included to deploy with one termianl command! (Coming soon!)

To run this application:

npm start
```
